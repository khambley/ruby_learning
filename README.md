First dabblings with Ruby language from Code Academy and Chris Pine book, Learning to Program with Ruby

# Code Academy Ruby
1. *01-formatting-strings.rb* - **Putting the Form in Formatter**
> This project will help you create a small program that will read a user's input and correct his or her capitalization. Users can provide an almost infinite range of input, so it makes our lives easier as programmers to make their input standard before doing anything with it.

2. *02-daffy_duckifier.rb* - **Thith Meanth War!**
> Now that we can direct our program using if / else statements, we can produce different results based on different user input. In this project, we'll combine control flow with a few new Ruby string methods to Daffy Duckify a user's string, replacing each "s" with "th".

3. *03-redacted.rb* - **Redacted**
> Hiding information is a major part of programming: protecting passwords, establishing secure connections, and securing programs against tampering all rely on controlling access to information. While we won't be able to really dig into information hiding until after we cover hashes in a later course, we can write a simple program to change a user's input with the tools we have now: arrays and iterators.

4. *04-histogram.rb* - **Arrays and Hashes**
> In this project, we'll build a program that takes a user's input, then builds a hash from that input. Each key in the hash will be a word from the user; each value will be the number of times that word occurs. For example, if our program gets the string "the rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain," it will return
```
the 2

falls 1

on 1

mainly 1

in 1

rain 1

plain 1

Spain 1
```

A visual representation of data like this is called a histogram.
04b. *04b-nested_arrays.rb* - Example of iterating over a multidimensional array

5. *05-ordering_your_library.rb* - **Ordering Your Library**
> We noticed in the last lesson that `.sort!` didn't have a built-in way of handling sorting in reverse alphabetical order. Now that we know how to write our own Ruby methods, we can fix that!

6a. *06a-movie_ratings_my.rb* - **A Night at the Movies**
> Keeping track of all the parts of our digital lives is a pain. Now that you know how to write Ruby, however, you can make things easy for yourself! Let's start by creating a program that will keep track of our movie ratings. It'll do one of four things: add a new movie to a hash, update the rating for an existing movie, display the movies and ratings that are already in the hash, or delete a movie from the hash. If it doesn't receive one of those four commands, the program will output some kind of error message. This project will give you a lot of room for creativity, but we know sometimes it can be a little disorienting to not have strict instructions. If you ever feel lost, don't hesitate to check out the example code in this exercise to help you along!

6b. *06b-movie_ratings_ca.rb* - **Code Academy Version - A Night At the Movies**
> Code Academy's solution to "A Night At the Movies"

6c. *06c-benchmark_test.rb* - **Dare To Compare**
> The code in the editor uses some new syntax, so don't worry about understanding all of it just yet. It builds two alphabet hashes: one that pairs string letters with their place in the alphabet ( "a" with 1, "b" with 2...) and one that uses symbols (:a with 1, :b with 2...). We'll look up the letter "r" 100,000 times to see which process runs faster! It's good to keep in mind that the numbers you'll see are only fractions of a second apart, and we did the hash lookup 100,000 times each. It's not much of a performance increase to use symbols in this case, but it's definitely there!


7. *07-refactory.rb* - **The Refactor Factory**
> All right! We're going to reinforce our knowledge of Ruby best practices by refactoring some existing code. As mentioned, refactoring is the process by which we improve a code's structure, appearance, and/or performance without modifying its overall behavior. The code in the editor is a Ruby method, first_n_primes, that takes a number n and generates a list of the first n prime numbers. Unfortunately, our poor author hasn't yet mastered all the tools available in Ruby. But we can fix that!

8. **Blocks, Procs, and Lambdas** - no file for this, just review

9. Object-Oriented Programming Part 1

10. Object-Oriented Programming Part 2

11. RUBY FINAL PROJECT - a to-do list application that you'll use via the Command Line
