First dabblings with Ruby language from Code Academy and Chris Pine book, Learning to Program with Ruby

1. *01-formatting-strings.rb* - **Putting the Form in Formatter**
> This project will help you create a small program that will read a user's input and correct his or her capitalization. Users can provide an almost infinite range of input, so it makes our lives easier as programmers to make their input standard before doing anything with it.

2. *02-daffy_duckifier.rb* - **Thith Meanth War!**
> Now that we can direct our program using if / else statements, we can produce different results based on different user input. In this project, we'll combine control flow with a few new Ruby string methods to Daffy Duckify a user's string, replacing each "s" with "th".

3. *03-redacted.rb* - **Redacted**
> Hiding information is a major part of programming: protecting passwords, establishing secure connections, and securing programs against tampering all rely on controlling access to information. While we won't be able to really dig into information hiding until after we cover hashes in a later course, we can write a simple program to change a user's input with the tools we have now: arrays and iterators.

4. *04-histogram.rb* - **Arrays and Hashes**
> In this project, we'll build a program that takes a user's input, then builds a hash from that input. Each key in the hash will be a word from the user; each value will be the number of times that word occurs. For example, if our program gets the string "the rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain," it will return
`the 2

falls 1

on 1

mainly 1

in 1

rain 1

plain 1

Spain 1`

A visual representation of data like this is called a histogram.
